## ⚡ 30-Second Setup (AI Agent Integration)

**macOS / Linux / Windows.** All you need is Node.js 18+.

```bash
npx -y kordoc setup
```

An interactive wizard:
1. Pick your AI client (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Claude Code / Windsurf / VS Code / Gemini CLI / Zed / Antigravity / Codex — installed ones show `[detected]`)
2. Patches the config file automatically → restart the client

Windows gets automatic `cmd /c npx` wrapping. No manual JSON editing. After restart, 15 document tools (`parse_document`, `parse_table`, `fill_form`, `patch_document`, `generate_document`, `place_seal`, …) are live.

> **Codex works too**: pick Codex in the wizard above, or register directly with one line —
> ```bash
> codex mcp add kordoc -- npx -y kordoc mcp
> ```

> **CLI-only usage** needs no install at all: `npx kordoc <file>`. See [CLI](#cli) below.

> **If you hit `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` / `Cannot find module ...\dist\cli.js`**: a broken global install is lingering. Fix with:
> ```powershell
> npm uninstall -g kordoc
> npx -y kordoc@latest setup
> ```

> **If Windows PowerShell blocks `npx.ps1` (`PSSecurityException`)**: that's PowerShell's default policy blocking unsigned `.ps1` scripts (not kordoc). Either run the same command in **cmd** instead, or relax the policy once from an admin PowerShell: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`.

### Install as a Claude Code plugin

Prefer a skill (SKILL.md) over MCP registration:

```
/plugin marketplace add chrisryugj/kordoc
/plugin install kordoc@kordoc
```

The kordoc skill auto-activates on `.hwp`/`.hwpx` mentions and Korean official-document generation/form-filling requests (it calls the `npx -y kordoc@^3` CLI internally — no separate install).

## 💡 What can you do with kordoc?

Beyond plain text extraction, kordoc automates the **entire lifecycle of Korean official documents**.

*   **📄 Any document to Markdown**: Convert `HWP3` (legacy), `HWP` (5.x), `HWPX`, `HWPML`, `PDF`, `XLS`, `XLSX`, `DOCX` — and `PNG`/`JPG`/`WebP` images (automatic OCR) — to `Markdown` instantly — the ideal shape for LLMs to read and reason about.
*   **📊 Faithful table reconstruction**: Borderless PDF tables and heavily merged HWP tables are analyzed structurally and restored as accurate markdown tables. Old-vs-new clause comparison tables in legislative amendment PDFs survive intact (v3.16.2).
*   **🔍 Automatic redline (diff)**: Compare two documents and see exactly what changed — including cross-format comparison (HWP vs HWPX).
*   **📝 Markdown back to HWPX**: Turn AI-written content back into report-form `HWPX`. No more copy-paste drudgery.
*   **🏛️ Government-standard document generation (v4.0)**: An official-document engine built by exhaustively decoding 16 real government templates plus 60 actually-approved drafts. Gaejosik reports (cover, TOC banner, Roman-numeral chapter headers, page numbers, approval box), draft documents (statutory head/foot blocks, automatic "끝."), public-notice and press-release presets, 8-level Korean item numbering, and a 13-rule notation linter (`kordoc lint`) — all verified down to the typeset output via Hancom COM rendering.
*   **🔄 Lossless format-preserving roundtrip (v3.0)**: Edit the converted markdown and hand it to `patchHwpx` (HWPX) / `patchHwp` (HWP 5.x binary) — only the changed paragraph/cell text is swapped in place, **without touching a single byte of the original formatting**. Row insertion/deletion inherits neighboring-row formatting (v3.7); filling originally-empty HWP 5.x cells works too (v3.8).
*   **🖼️ Layout-preserving render (v3.10–3.17)**: Reproduce the original layout as SVG from Hancom's saved typesetting cache; files without a cache (AI-generated HWPX, edited output) are typeset directly by a **pure-TS reflow engine**. Multi-page, multi-section, per-run fonts, landscape pages, tables, drawing shapes, search-term highlighting — HWPX previews on a server with no Hancom installed.
*   **📊 Chart generation (v3.16)**: A markdown ```chart fence (type/cat/series lines) becomes a native Hancom chart (OOXML chartSpace) — 20 types including bar/line/pie/donut/area/scatter/radar, with per-series colors.
*   **🔴 Stamp/signature placement (v3.16)**: Finds anchor phrases like "(인)" ("seal here") and places a stamp PNG as a floating object in front of text. Tables and pages never grow, so stamping doesn't shift the layout (`kordoc seal`).
*   **✏️ Form auto-fill**: Feed values into official form templates (applications, reports) and every blank is filled — preserving 100% of the original formatting (font, size, alignment).
*   **🤖 AI agent integration (MCP)**: Let `Claude`, `Cursor`, and friends call `kordoc` directly to read and produce documents.

## What's New in v4.2.3

- **Inline table/text order preservation (#49·#50)**: when an inline (treatAsChar) table and text alternate within one paragraph or one cell (date-range form fields like `[date] from [date] to`), text was pulled ahead of the tables, reversing the reading order. Both top-level `blocks` and `IRCell.blocks` now follow document order, and the generator emits cells in the same order for symmetric roundtrips. Floating/page-anchored tables stay out of the text flow as before. (reported by @jumaniac)

## What's New in v4.2.2

- **~~Strikethrough~~ extraction (HWP5·HWPX)**: deletion marks in legislative amendment documents now survive as markdown `~~strikethrough~~`. Detection uses a strike-**shape** whitelist — Hancom stores the strikethrough bits as a default even on non-struck text (measured in upstream rhwp), so only real line kinds count and unknown values fail closed. HWPX supports partial-run strikes; HWP5 works at paragraph level.
- **ZIP decompression limit 100→256MB**: large real-world documents with a single 75MB section XML (found in rhwp's 10k-document survey) were being rejected as ZIP bombs — limit raised.

## What's New in v4.2.1

- **🖼️ Direct image input (PNG/JPG/WebP)**: convert screenshots and scanned images without wrapping them in a PDF — `kordoc form.png` / `parse(buffer)` / MCP `parse_document`. Images have no text layer, so the built-in OCR is applied automatically (no flag needed; decoding uses the optional dependency `sharp`).
- **📐 Raster ruling-line detection for scans**: the OCR path now finds horizontal/vertical table rules directly in the page pixels (binarization + run-length, no ML) and feeds them into the line-based table pipeline. Forms with tall merged label cells and multi-line prose cells (Korean government submission forms) are restored as proper tables with rowspan/colspan. The cluster detector remains as the fallback for borderless tables.

## What's New in v4.2.0

- **👓 Built-in text OCR (PP-OCRv5 korean)**: read scanned/image PDFs with **local inference, no API key** — `parse(buffer, { ocr: true })` / CLI `--ocr` / MCP `parse_document`'s `ocr` option. Models (~18MB) auto-download with SHA-256 verification on first use. Only pages flagged by the quality signals (scans, broken font mappings) are OCR'd — clean pages keep their parsed output — and OCR line boxes are fed through the table-detection pipeline, so **tables survive in scans**. Korean dictionary covers all 11,172 precomposed Hangul syllables; ≈1s per page on CPU.
- **🩹 HWP3 legacy parser conformance ×3**: stream-consumption defects for tab/field-code/bookmark control chars corrupted all following text, and roman numerals (Ⅰ–Ⅹ), circled digits (①–⑩), quotes, and bullet glyphs silently vanished — fixed by porting follow-up patches from the upstream (rhwp) source.
- **🐛 Formula-OCR page off-by-one**: `--pages` filtering was shifted by one page and formulas attached to the previous page's blocks (pdfium page indices are 0-based). Also fixed: XLSX/XLS `--keep-empty-cols` wiring gap.

## What's New in v4.1.0

- **👁️ `render_document` MCP tool (new)**: renders a generated/patched/filled HWPX exactly as typeset and **returns it as a PNG image in the response** — the AI can visually inspect its own output and fix it, closing the generate→render→verify loop inside MCP (typeset cache for Hancom-saved files, reflow engine for generated ones, search-term highlighting).
- **🕶️ `kordoc redact` + `redact_document` MCP (new)**: detects PII (resident registration no., phone, email, card, account; passport/driver license opt-in) and outputs a **format-preserving masked** HWPX/HWP (`850315-●●●●●●●`). Birthdate/Luhn validation reduces false positives; the report never contains the original PII. An assistive detector — human review before disclosure is required.
- **📦 `--format chunks` + `parse_chunks` MCP (new)**: structure-preserving chunk JSON for RAG — heading/outline hierarchy (□○- / 1.·가.·1)) becomes breadcrumb paths, tables become standalone chunks.
- **📋 Trailing empty column preservation (#47)**: blank input columns in form documents were deleted wholesale during parsing — the new `keepTrailingEmptyCols` parse option (CLI `--keep-empty-cols`) preserves anchored empty columns (phantom span-inflation columns are still trimmed), and **form paths (parse_form / fill) always preserve them**, so fillable fields no longer vanish from field listings. Reported by [@jumaniac](https://github.com/jumaniac).
- **📅 XLSX/XLS date conversion**: date cells no longer surface as serial numbers ("45306") but as ISO ("2024-01-15") — built-in and custom numFmt detection, date1904 handling.
- **🛡️ Production-wide review, ~80 fixes**: hostile-file hardening (equation regex ReDoS, HTML table span explosion, HWP3 decompression bomb, XLSX grid blowup), table-only PDFs misjudged as image-based, HWP5 control-char (hyphen/fixed-width space) mapping, DOCX tracked-change insertions lost, four form-fill label mismatch classes, HWP5 patch data remanence zeroed, MCP write-path validation, lined-table PDF performance (62,500 vertices 3.1s→0.2s), and more — see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## What's New in v4.0.8

- **🖼️ PDF image extraction (new)**: previously only image *region coordinates* were computed and the bytes were silently lost — image XObjects are now decoded and re-encoded as PNG in pure JS (including waiting for pdfjs's async decoding; 731 images across 45 of 52 corpus PDFs). References are emitted at end-of-page positions, cross-page duplicates (logos/watermarks) are deduped, and cross-page table merging is unaffected.
- **🖼️ HWPX/HWP5 unreferenced-BinData sweep**: images the body walk can't reach — pictures inside headers/footers (press-release photo strips), cell-background images (borderFill imgBrush in approval documents) — are now recovered as image blocks at the end of the document. Corpus recovery: HWPX 686/686, HWP5 92/92 (100%).
- **🖼️ DOCX `w:object` images**: OLE object previews (`v:imagedata`) were missing from extraction — fixed (mc:Fallback copies remain excluded as duplicates).

## What's New in v4.0.7

- **🔗 DOCX hyperlink mass-loss fix**: paragraphs with multiple links kept only the last one; links are now emitted inline `[text](url)` in document order. **Field-code HYPERLINK** (`fldSimple`/`fldChar`, common in Word/Google Docs exports) and internal anchor links are handled (a measured document went from 176→21 links lost to zero).
- **🖼️ DOCX image body links**: images were extracted to files but never referenced as `![image](...)` in the markdown — now emitted inline at paragraph positions.
- **🔍 PDF mis-mapped mojibake detection**: ToUnicode mis-mappings producing valid-but-wrong Hangul passed silently — now detected via final-consonant (batchim) distribution, emitting per-page NEEDS_OCR warnings with reason `garbled_hangul`.

## What's New in v4.0.6

- **📊 PDF border-less band table fragmentation fix**: budget-ledger tables whose summary-row bands omit vertical rules lost department names — broken vertical segments are now bridged with a 4-way guard (637 sites measured in a real district budget).
- **📝 HWPX nested tables inside captions preserved (#46)**: table content inside a caption vanished wholesale (297 of 304 chars) — now flattened in document order. Report by [@jumaniac](https://github.com/jumaniac), advice by @hiSandog.

## What's New in v4.0.5

- **🖍️ Inline emphasis for any Hancom document**: bold/italic runs in HWPX files **not generated by kordoc** are now restored as markdown `**`/`*` markers (attribute-based detection, with automatic merging of runs split by Hancom's edit history). Structurally-bold cells (e.g. table header rows) are left unmarked.
- **🏛️ Gongmun-mode emphasis round-trip**: re-parsing an official-document HWPX preserves inline `**emphasis**` inside items, automatically distinguished from structural bold (e.g. fully-bold □ level-1 items in report numbering).
- **↔️ List-depth round-trip**: `1)` / `-` items parsed back from official documents no longer collapse to level 1 on regeneration ('1)'→'2.', '-'→□) — indentation is inverted into leading spaces, so draft/report/gaejosik double round-trips converge.

## What's New in v4.0.4

- **🖋️ Reflow object-flow model**: floating tables push text below them, page-anchored / behind-text objects don't participate in flow, inline tables advance by effective height + leading — self-consistency **59/59 (100%)** on the real-approval corpus. Mixed-cache documents (Hancom-saved files partially edited programmatically) also render at correct positions.
- **🎨 Format profile 0.3.0**: cell **font-name round-trip** (`fontName_hangul` — reproduce fonts without the source document), first-row fingerprint `anchor_row`, column widths preserved for tables whose first row is fully merged, and pre-validation of hand-edited border values (type/mm/color).
- **🧰 CLI/MCP option-surface unification**: gongmun option assembly and value sets share a single SSOT — no more drift between the two interfaces (6 missing MCP preset aliases restored). Byte-identical outputs verified across the refactor.
- **↔️ Round-trip hardening**: bold/italic/code markers inside table cells, paragraph-indent observation slot (`IRBlock.indent`), circled-number fallback parity beyond 15/51, nested-table height precision, adaptive footer rule width.

## What's New in v4.0.3

- **🛡️ Production hardening**: fixes confirmed by a two-pass adversarial review — explicit rejection of invalid numeric options (NaN / out-of-range), font-name XML escaping, cover/TOC extended to all presets (except press), body-font override no longer ignored when cover/TOC assets are on, heading hierarchy inversion at ≤13pt, and cell-object caption misattribution / false loss warnings.
- **📏 New defaults from field measurements**: 12pt body for draft documents and □→ㅇ→\* numbering for plans (previous behavior via `--pt 15` / `numbering: 'standard'`).

## What's New in v4.0.2

- **📏 Benchmarked against real approved documents**: 60 actually-approved government drafts (Seoul open-government archive) plus ministry templates were exhaustively decoded and compared against kordoc's output — 17 gaps catalogued, 9 fixed.
  - **Typesetting-area root fix**: generated documents lacked a column definition (`colPr`), so Hancom narrowed the text area by 10mm on each side and wide tables spilled into the right margin — now zero overflow across all presets (measured via COM rendering).
  - **Draft-document head/foot blocks** (`--doc-head`/`--doc-foot`, statutory form), **press-release preset** (`press`), **public-notice head** (`--notice-head`), **report-info line** (`--report-info`).
  - Column-width allocation rewritten (per-column floor = widest word — short columns no longer shatter vertically), 12pt table cells, draft margins matched to the dominant real-world value (20/15/20/15), level-2 bullet ㅇ/○ split by preset (`--bullet2`).
- Released after passing an eye-QA gate by a working civil servant.

## What's New in v4.0.1

- **✍️ Practitioner QA fixes**: bold text no longer swaps fonts to HY견고딕/Arial Black ("mystery font" bug), h2 section markers via `--h2-marker` (box □ / number / none), and the third-level dash ― corrected to the real-world hyphen `-`.
- **📝 13-rule official-notation linter**: `kordoc lint <file>` checks dates, times, amounts, attachment notation, etc.; generation also emits warnings inline.

## What's New in v4.0.0

- **🏛️ Government-standard gaejosik report, complete**: built from an exhaustive decode of 16 real government documents — cover page (gradient title box, accent bars), TOC banner, Roman-numeral chapter headers, page numbers ("- 1 -", cover/TOC excluded), approval box, automatic "끝." end mark, body title box. Tables get the measured government grammar automatically (shaded bold header with double rule, 0.4mm outer border hierarchy, content-proportional column widths, right-aligned placement). `--preset 개조식`.

## What's New in v3.18.0

- **🎨 Format profiles**: reproduce a table's **borders, shading, measured column widths, and cell fonts** — not just its merge topology — without shipping the source document. Extract style-only JSON from a reference hwpx with `hwpxToProfile(hwpx)`, then apply it to another document via `markdownToHwpx(md, { profile })` — share and reproduce an organization's formatting without leaking its content (issue #41, schema [`docs/format-profile-spec.md`](docs/format-profile-spec.md)). Schema & samples contributed by [@ai-localgov-officer](https://github.com/ai-localgov-officer) (PR #42).

## What's New in v3.17.0

- **🖼️ Render fidelity**: per-run fonts (gothic titles no longer fall back to the serif root font), full multi-section rendering (cover + body documents render every section), landscape page rotation (wide tables no longer clipped at the right edge), and page splitting for back-to-back full-page table paragraphs (trailing pages no longer pile onto one page).
- **✍️ Approval-box overlap fixed (reflow)**: In cache-less documents, the approval box's label table and stamp table were printed on top of each other — now placed side by side exactly like Hancom. Nested-table cell heights are measured correctly as well.

## What's New in v3.16

- **📊 Chart generation**: Markdown ```chart fences (type/cat/series lines) become native Hancom charts (OOXML chartSpace) — 20 types, per-series/slice colors; malformed fences fall back to a code block.
- **🔴 Stamp/signature placement**: `kordoc seal` — finds anchors like "(인)"/"서명 또는 인" and places the stamp PNG as a float in front of text without growing tables/pages (MCP `place_seal` included). Nested tables, text boxes, and tab/multi-line paragraphs are approximate and reported via `warnings` — verify in Hancom and fine-tune with `--dx`/`--dy` (dx_mm/dy_mm).
- **🔌 Claude Code plugin**: `/plugin marketplace add chrisryugj/kordoc` → the kordoc skill auto-activates for `.hwp`/`.hwpx`/official-document requests.
- **🩹 3.16.1 patch**: 55 defects from an adversarial production review fixed in one sweep — stamp placement (rowspan/colspan/nested-table origins), chart value parser (thousands separators, CRLF markdown), form-fill guards (`require_unique`), CLI `fill -o` output, and other "success message, silently wrong output" bugs.
- **🩹 3.16.2 patch**: PDF parser no longer mistakes the `<신 설>` ("newly inserted") notation inside old-vs-new clause comparison tables for a text box — a 30-page amendment comparison table is restored as one intact table instead of being shredded into paragraphs.

## Install

```bash
npm install kordoc
```

Optional dependencies for PDF parsing (pdfjs-dist), formula OCR, etc. are **installed by
default** (optionalDependencies). To slim the install, skip them with
`npm install kordoc --omit=optional` — PDF parsing, formula OCR, and print rendering
will then be unavailable.

## Quick Start

### Parse a document

```typescript
import { parse } from "kordoc"
import { readFileSync } from "fs"

const buffer = readFileSync("business-plan.hwpx")
const result = await parse(buffer)

if (result.success) {
  console.log(result.markdown)       // markdown text
  console.log(result.blocks)         // IRBlock[] structured data
  console.log(result.metadata)       // { title, author, createdAt, ... }
}
```

### Compare documents (redline)

```typescript
import { compare } from "kordoc"

const diff = await compare(oldBuffer, newBuffer)
// diff.stats → { added: 3, removed: 1, modified: 5, unchanged: 42 }
// diff.diffs → BlockDiff[] (tables include cell-level diffs)
```

Cross-format comparison (HWP vs HWPX) works too.

### Extract form fields

```typescript
import { parse, extractFormFields } from "kordoc"

const result = await parse(buffer)
if (result.success) {
  const form = extractFormFields(result.blocks)
  // form.fields → [{ label: "성명", value: "홍길동", row: 0, col: 0 }, ...]
  // form.confidence → 0.85
}
```

### Auto-fill a form

```typescript
import { fillForm } from "kordoc"
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "fs"

const template = readFileSync("application.hwpx")

// HWPX format-preserving mode — fonts, sizes, alignment 100% intact
const result = await fillForm(template, {
  성명: "홍길동",
  주민등록번호: "900101-1234567",
  주소: "서울특별시 광진구 능동로 120",
}, "hwpx-preserve")

writeFileSync("application_filled.hwpx", Buffer.from(result.output as ArrayBuffer))
// result.fill.filled → [{ label: "성명", value: "홍길동" }, ...]
// result.fill.unmatched → keys that failed to match
```

### Generate HWPX (reverse conversion)

```typescript
import { markdownToHwpx } from "kordoc"

const hwpxBuffer = await markdownToHwpx("# Title\n\nBody text\n\n| Name | Rank |\n| --- | --- |\n| 홍길동 | 과장 |")
writeFileSync("out.hwpx", Buffer.from(hwpxBuffer))

// Display math blocks become native HWPX equations (<hp:equation>).
// Supported: a limited LaTeX-like subset — \frac, \sqrt, sub/superscripts,
// Greek, integrals/limits, arrows, relations, matrix family.
const withEquation = await markdownToHwpx("Pythagoras\n\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$")

// Official-document mode — 8-level Korean item numbering + hanging indent
// + official margins/serif defaults
const gongmun = await markdownToHwpx("1. 추진배경\n  - 세부 항목\n2. 추진계획", {
  gongmun: { preset: "보고서" },  // official | report | plan | notice | minutes | gaejosik | press
})
```

From the CLI: `kordoc generate report.md -o report.hwpx --preset 보고서`

### Layout-preserving render (HWPX → SVG)

Draws the typesetting cache Hancom stores in HWPX (line coordinates, cell grids, object anchors) as absolutely-positioned SVG. Fast (no typesetting engine needed) and works on servers without Hancom. Multi-page vertical stack, search-term highlighting, and drawing shapes are supported (v3.14–15). Files without a cache (`markdownToHwpx` output, AI-generated or edited files) are typeset directly by the **pure-TS reflow engine** with `reflow: true` (v3.15). Equation objects are not rendered yet.

```typescript
import { renderHwpxToSvg } from "kordoc"

const r = await renderHwpxToSvg(readFileSync("approval.hwpx"), { highlights: ["예산"] })
writeFileSync("approval.svg", r.svg)
// r.width/r.height (pt), r.pageCount, r.stats { texts, images, tables }, r.warnings

const g = await renderHwpxToSvg(generatedHwpx, { reflow: true }) // cache-less files
```

From the CLI: `kordoc render approval.hwpx -o approval.svg` (`--reflow`, `--highlight 예산,집행`) — for continuous rendering use `kordoc render-worker` (stdin NDJSON).

### Page ranges

```typescript
const result = await parse(buffer, { pages: "1-3" })      // pages 1–3 only
const result = await parse(buffer, { pages: [1, 5, 10] })  // specific pages
```

### OCR (scanned/image-based PDFs) — built-in engine (v4.2.0+)

```typescript
// Built-in OCR (PP-OCRv5 korean, ~18MB models auto-downloaded on first use)
const result = await parse(buffer, { ocr: true })     // only pages that need OCR
const result = await parse(buffer, { ocr: "force" })  // force-OCR every page
```

- **No API key or external service** — det (DBNet) + rec (CTC) ONNX inference on local CPU
  (official PaddlePaddle conversions, Apache-2.0).
- **Page-precise**: scanned pages and pages with broken ToUnicode mappings (the `needsOcr`
  signals) are OCR'd; clean pages keep their parsed output.
- **Tables survive**: OCR line boxes go through the same xy-cut + cluster table detection
  pipeline, so table structure is reconstructed even from scans.
- To use an external OCR instead, pass a provider function as before:

```typescript
const result = await parse(buffer, {
  ocr: async (pageImage, pageNumber, mimeType) => {
    return await myOcrService.recognize(pageImage) // Claude Vision, Tesseract, ...
  }
})
```

### PDF text-quality signals (v2.9+)

PDFs often have a text layer with broken ToUnicode/CMap or control characters mixed in. `parsePdf` returns per-page quality signals.

```typescript
const r = await parsePdf(buffer)
if (r.success && r.qualitySummary?.needsOcr) {
  // retry with the built-in OCR (v4.2.0+) — or route to your own OCR queue
  const retried = await parse(buffer, { ocr: true })
}

for (const p of r.pageQuality ?? []) {
  if (p.needsOcr) console.log(`p${p.page} needs review: ${p.ocrReason}`)

## MCP Server (Claude / Cursor / Windsurf / Codex)

**Automatic setup (recommended)**:

```bash
npx -y kordoc setup
```

Detects your AI client interactively and patches its config file — including `cmd /c npx` wrapping on Windows. See [30-Second Setup](#-30-second-setup-ai-agent-integration).

For Codex, the wizard registers the server through `codex mcp add` rather than editing its TOML config directly.

**Manual setup for Codex**:

```bash
codex mcp add kordoc -- npx -y kordoc mcp
```

**Manual registration (macOS / Linux)**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kordoc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "kordoc", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Manual registration (Windows — when Claude Desktop can't find `.cmd`)**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kordoc": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "kordoc", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
